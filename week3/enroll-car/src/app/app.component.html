<!-- Directions: Use some input elements to make a basic form in your app component. 
    When you click the button to submit the form, it pushes that information, 
    as an object, into an array. 
    Use *ngFor to loop over that array and show the information 
    as a list somewhere on the page. Items in that list must be a child component. -->

<!-- Optional: Add a button to the child component that deletes that item from the list, 
    using the @Output decorator -->

<!--Building off of the code that you guys wrote last night for the assignment, 
    make your inputs into a form. The form must have at least 5 form controls, 
    and 3 different kinds of Validators. If the form is invalid, 
    then display some text to the user and disable the submit button.-->
